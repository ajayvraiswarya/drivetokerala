District administrative headquarters in the Indian State of Kerala.\r\n                    Alappuzha is a town and municipality in Kerala with a population of 174,164 people\r\n                    and ranks third among the districts in literacy rate in the State of Kerala.\r\n                    It is a major tourist destination in India. Alappuzha's Backwaters is one of Kerala's most popular\r\n                    tourist attractions. A houseboat cruise can be booked in these backwaters. It connects Kumarakom and\r\n                    Cochin to the north and Quilon to the south. The Kerala State Water Transport Department offers\r\n                    government boat services in the district, in addition to the houseboat services.\r\n                    It is also the point of entry for the annual Nehru Trophy Boat Race, held every year on the\r\n                    Punnamada Lake near Alappuzha on the second Saturday of August. That's the most competitive and\r\n                    famous of Indian boat races. The mullackal chirap is also one of Alapuzha's attractions which is the\r\n                    December festive season held every year for ten days.\r\n                    Alappuzha is home to both the Punnapra-Vayalar rebellion against the British, and the Feudal Raj\r\n                    revolt. The Diwan's unit, 200 men at Punnapra on 24 October 1946 and more than 150 at Vayalar on 27\r\n                    October 1946 killed members of the Communist Party. The total loss of life is estimated to be in\r\n                    excess of a thousand.\r\n                    <br><b>History:</b>\r\n                    The Viceroy of the Indian Empire in the early first decade of the 20th century, Lord Curzon visited\r\n                    Alleppey, now Alappuzha, in the Capital.\r\n                    They called the early Cheras, who had their home in Kuttanad, 'Kuttuvans,' so named after this\r\n                    location. In their classical works Pliny and Ptolemy from the 1st and 2nd centuries had described\r\n                    places such as Purakkad or Barace.\r\n                    History tells that in the Middle Ages Alappuzha had trade ties with Greece and Rome.\r\n                    Literary works like \"Unnuneeli Sandesam\" give some insight into the ancient period of this district.\r\n                    Archaeological antiquities, such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the\r\n                    temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic importance of Alappuzha District.\r\n                    Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD.\r\n                    The Kokkamangalam church was one of the seven churches founded by St. Thomas, one of Jesus Christ's\r\n                    twelve disciples. It is generally believed that in 52 AD he landed in Muziris Port at Maliankara,\r\n                    currently known as Cranganore or Kodungallur, and preached Christianity in South India.\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor\">Places To Visit In ALAPPUZHA</h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<section class=\"event team-sec team-grid speaker set-relative\" id=\"speaker\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj14.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\">Alappuzha Beach</h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \"></h6>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            Alappuzha Beach is a beach in the town of Alappuzha and a tourist destination in Kerala,\r\n                            India.

The\r\n                            territory that would later be known as Fort Kochi was given by the Kochi Rajah to the\r\n                            Portuguese in 1503, after he was supported by Afonso de Albuquerque's forces to combat the\r\n                            Kozhikode Saamoothiri's forces. The Rajah also gave them permission to construct Fort\r\n                            Emmanuel near the waterfront to safeguard their business interests. The first part of the\r\n                            Fort Kochi name comes from this fort, which was later ruined by the Dutch.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            The Portuguese founded their settlement behind the fort including a wooden church that was\r\n                            rebuilt as a permanent structure in 1516, now known as the St Francis Church. Fort Kochi\r\n                            remained in control of Portugal for 160 years. In 1683 the Dutch invaded the Portuguese\r\n                            territories and destroyed many Portuguese institutions including Catholic convents. The\r\n                            Dutch kept Fort Kochi in their hands for 112 years until 1795, when the British defeated the\r\n                            Dutch to take control. Fort Kochi's international influence ceased with Indian independence\r\n                            in 1947.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            <button class=\"buttonco\"><a routerLink='/blog/contact-us'>Enquire Now..</a></button>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\">PADMANABHASWAMY TEMPLE\r\n                        </h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \"></h6>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            The Temple has been referred to in the Sangam Period of literature between 500 BCE and 300\r\n                            CE several times.

The\r\n                            palace is made from teakwood, rosewood, marble, and granite. The roof of the palace is made\r\n                            of wood and 42 beams support the carved patterns. The roof is supported by pillars made of\r\n                            granite.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            Floral motifs dot the ceiling of the verandah.The main 16 rooms of the palace are\r\n                            constructed in 16 different patterns.In all, the palace contains 80 rooms, of which 20 were\r\n                            opened for visitors in 1995.

They needed a bridge. This was also constructed to keep wild\r\n                            animals from entering the inhabited side, a bridge that was made to shake when any one gets\r\n                            on it, this shaking scared off the animals so they wouldn't cross the bridge.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            <button class=\"buttonco\"><a routerLink='/blog/contact-us'>Enquire Now..</a></button>\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj30.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\">Palakkad Fort\r\n                        </h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \"></h6>\r\n\r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            It is said that the Palakkad Fort existed from ancient times, but it is assumed that it was\r\n                            built in the present form in 1766 A.D., but little is known about its early history. The\r\n                            local ruler, Palakkad Achchan, was initially a Zamorin tributary but had become independent\r\n                            before the early 18th century. In 1757 he sent Hyder Ali a deputation seeking support\r\n                            against an invasion that was threatened by the Zamorin. Hyder Ali took advantage of the\r\n                            chance to obtain a strategically important position such as Palghat, and from that time\r\n                            until 1790 the fort was in the possession of the Mysore Sultans or the British.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            The latter took it for the first time in 1768 when it was seized by Colonel Wood during his\r\n                            assault on the fortresses of Hyder Ali, but Haider took it back a few months later. Colonel\r\n                            Fullarton recaptured it in 1783, after a siege that lasted for eleven days but was abandoned\r\n                            the following year. Later, it fell into the Zamorin troops 'possession. It was finally\r\n                            captured under Colonel Stuart by the British in 1790. It has been restored and used as a\r\n                            base for operations that ended with the Srirangapatnam storming. The fort remained in\r\n                            garrison until mid-19th century.

On October 30,\r\n                            1505, the building of the wooden fort was completed: its first captain was Lourenco Britto,\r\n                            who commanded a garrison of 150 Portuguese men, and controlled two ships at sea.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            After the fort had been completed, Almeida began using the title of \"Viceroy,\" and in 1507\r\n                            he began building a stone fort on the site.\r\n\r\n                            Later, in the Siege of Cannanore (1507), the fort was struck in vain by local Indian ruler\r\n                            Zamorin and Kolathiri.\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            <button class=\"buttonco\"><a routerLink='/blog/contact-us'>Enquire Now..</a></button>\r\n\r\n\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-pilgrimage',\r\n  templateUrl: './pilgrimage.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./pilgrimage.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class PilgrimageComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  experts = [\r\n    {\r\n      img: \"assets/images/event/aj11.jpg\",\r\n      name: \"Sabarimala\",\r\n      designation: \"temple complex located at Sabarimala inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Perinad Village, Pathanamthitta district.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      img: \"assets/images/event/aj1.jpg\",\r\n      name: \"Padmanabhaswamy Temple\",\r\n      designation: \"Dedicated to Lord Vishnu, it is one of the 108 sacred Vishnu temples or 'Divya Deshams' in India.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      img: \"assets/images/event/aj28.jpg\",\r\n      name: \"Guruvayur Temple\",\r\n      designation: \"The presiding deity of the Guruvayur Temple is Vishnu, worshipped in the form of his avatar Krishna.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      img: \"assets/images/event/aj5.jpg\",\r\n      name: \"Attukal Temple\",\r\n      designation: \"Attukal Devi is often referred as Kannaki, the heroine of Ilanko Adikal's 'Silapathikaaram'.\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      img: \"assets/images/event/aj6.jpg\",\r\n      name: \"Agastyarkudam\",\r\n      designation: \"Agastyarkoodam is believed to be the abode of the great Hindu Sage Agasthya.

Diwali is usually celebrated eighteen days after the Dussehra (Dasara,\r\n                                Dasain) festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of\r\n                                the festival when celebrities prepare by cleaning their homes and making floor\r\n                                decorations, such as rangoli. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi, or the regional\r\n                                equivalent which is Diwali proper for Hindus in southern India. Western, southern,\r\n                                eastern, and northern Indian cultures celebrate Diwali's main day on the third day,\r\n                                Lakshmi Puja's day, and the traditional month's darkest night.\r\n\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                In some parts of India the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and\r\n                                Balipratipada (Padwa), dedicated to the wife-husband relationship. Some Hindu\r\n                                communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent dedicated to the\r\n                                connection between sister and brother, while other groups of Hindu and Sikh craftsmen\r\n                                mark this day as Vishwakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their\r\n                                workspaces and offering prayers.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>History</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                The Diwali festival is possibly a combination of ancient Indian harvest festivals. It is\r\n                                mentioned in Sanskrit texts like the Padma Purana, the Skanda Purana which were both\r\n                                completed in the second half of the 1st millennium CE. In Skanda Kishore Purana the\r\n                                diyas (lamps) are described as symbolizing parts of the sun, identifying it as the\r\n                                celestial giver of light and energy to all life and which transitions seasonally in\r\n                                Kartik's Hindu calendar month.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                King Harsha refers to Deepavali, the Sanskrit play Nagananda in the 7th century, as\r\n                                Dīpapratipadotsava, where lamps were lit and gifts were received from newly engaged\r\n                                brides and grooms. In his ninth century Kavyamimamsa, Rajasekhara referred to Deepavali\r\n                                as Dipamalika, in which he describes the custom of whitewashed homes and oil lamps\r\n                                decorating houses, streets and night markets\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Numerous travelers from outside India have also identified Diwali. The Persian explorer\r\n                                and historian Al Biruni wrote in his 11th-century autobiography on India about Deepavali\r\n                                being celebrated by Hindus on New Moon Day in the month of Kartika. The Venetian\r\n                                merchant and explorer Niccolò de 'Conti visited India in the early 15th century and\r\n                                wrote in his memoirs, \"An infinite number of oil lamps, which are held burning day and\r\n                                night, are placed on each of these festivals inside their temples and on the outside of\r\n                                the roofs,\" and that the families would assemble, \"clothe themselves in new clothes,\"\r\n                                sing, dance and festival.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Portuguese traveler Domingo Paes of the 16th century wrote of his visit to the Hindu\r\n                                Vijayanagara Empire, where in October Dipavali was celebrated with lamps illuminating\r\n                                householders and temples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-kathakali',\r\n  templateUrl: './kathakali.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./kathakali.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class KathakaliComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<section class=\"app1 download\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1500\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-content center-mobile\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/a15.JPG\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-1 col-md-6\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-text\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <div class=\"download-img d-flex\">\r\n                            <div class=\"set-relative\">\r\n\r\n                                <div class=\"set-abs elipse center-abs\">\r\n                                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/download/Ellipse.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"center-img-content m-l-15\">\r\n                                <h3 class=\"m-b-5 focolor\">Kathakali</h3>\r\n                                <p>\r\n                                </p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"information\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n\r\n                                Kathakali is a significant genre of Indian classical dance.

Kathakali is a Hindu performance art in\r\n                                south-west India's Malayalam-speaking region.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The origins of the Kathakalī are uncertain. Kathakalī's fully evolved style emerged\r\n                                around the 17th century, but its origins lie in the temple and folk arts (such as\r\n                                Kutiyattam and the religious drama of the southwestern Indian peninsula), which can be\r\n                                traced back to at least the 1st millennium CE.A Kathakali production, like all India's\r\n                                classical dance arts, synthesizes music, vocal dancers, choreography, and hand- and\r\n                                facial movements. Kathakali, however, varies in that it also combines moves from ancient\r\n                                Indian martial arts and South India sporting styles.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The Kathakalī's common themes are folk mythologies, religious stories, and philosophical\r\n                                concepts from the Hindu epics and Puranas. Historically, the vocal performance was\r\n                                performed in Sanskritised Malayalam. Indian Kathakali troops have featured women\r\n                                performers in contemporary works, as well as adapted Western stories and plays such as\r\n                                Shakespeare's.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>History</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Kathakalī's elements and features can be found in ancient Sanskrit texts such as the\r\n                                Natya Shastra. The kathakali is credited to sage Bharata, and its first full compilation\r\n                                is between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates differ between 500 BCE and 500 CE.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of around 6000 verses\r\n                                divided into 36 chapters. The text, says Natalia Lidova, explains the theory of Tāava\r\n                                dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, bhāva, speech, movements, techniques of acting, basic\r\n                                steps, standing positions – all of which are part of classical Indian dances like\r\n                                Kathakali.

The Shloka portion is the metric verse, written\r\n                                in third person, mostly entirely in Sanskrit, explaining the choreography component of\r\n                                the action. Both such plays have traditionally been drawn from Hindu scriptures such as\r\n                                the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Bhagavata Purana.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                A repertoire of Kathakalī is an operatic production in which an ancient tale is\r\n                                playfully dramatized. A Kathakali performance is usually long, beginning at dusk and\r\n                                continuing through dawn, with interludes and breaks for the performers and audience.\r\n                                Some plays continued for many hours, beginning every day at dusk.

The sadhu instructed the King to call him\r\n                                'Manikandan,' one with a golden face, as the child was wearing a gold chain.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Rajashekhara took Manikandan home and told his queen about the happenings.\r\n                                They both thought LordShiva had blessed them himself. Everyone but the Diwan, who had\r\n                                entertained hopes to become king after Rajashekhara, rejoiced at the joy of the royal\r\n                                couple.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                As a boy, Manikandan was precocious and very intelligent. With his intellect and\r\n                                extraordinary skills, he excelled in martial arts and shastras, and amazed his mentor.\r\n                                Peace and prosperity at Pandalam reigned. Ayyappan's guru finally concluded that the boy\r\n                                was no ordinary mortal but a divine being. After finishing his studies, Manikandan went\r\n                                up to his teacher to give guru dakshina and in effect seek his blessings.\r\n                                As he approached his spiritual master for ashirwaadams, Manikandan was explained by the\r\n                                guru what he had already believed about him, that he was a divine power destined for\r\n                                heroic glory. The guru then beseeched him to give his blind and stupid son vision and\r\n                                voice. Manikandan laid his hands on the son of the guru and the boy acquired eyesight\r\n                                and speech immediately. Requesting to show this miracle to everyone, Manikandan went\r\n                                back to the royal quarters.\r\n                                In the meantime the Queen gave birth to a male child named Raja Rajan. Sensing this\r\n                                extraordinary turn of events was somehow inextricably linked to Manikandan, Rajasekara\r\n                                chose to make him King; he evidently named his eldest son Lord Ayyappan. Everbody,\r\n                                excluding the King's Diwan, was rejoicing. This wily minister, who secretly nursed\r\n                                kingly aspirations, despised Manikandan and devised several schemes including food\r\n                                poisoning to exterminate the divine avatar. Manikandan had a few narrow flights, but his\r\n                                body bore an injury that no one was able to heal. Finally, the young boy is healed by\r\n                                Lord Shiva himself in a healer's garb.\r\n                                His plans foiled, the Diwan told the Queen that succeeding Rajasekara as her own son was\r\n                                alive was extremely inappropriate for Manikandan. Since Arthasastra excuses any misdeed\r\n                                with a noble end, he instigated her to feign illness; he told the Queen that he would\r\n                                have his doctor declare that she could only be healed by adding tigress 'milk.\r\n                                Manikandan would be compelled to go to the forest where he would fall prey to wild\r\n                                animals, or even if he returned home without the mission, the love of Rajasekara for him\r\n                                would be the same as before.\r\n                                Blinded by her loyalty to her own son, the Queen promised to help the Diwan, and claimed\r\n                                she had a terrible headache. The King became concerned and summoned his doctors who had\r\n                                been unable to revive the seemingly ailing Queen. The Diwan's accomplice finally\r\n                                declared that she would only be cured of the disease if a lactating tigress 'milk had\r\n                                been made available. Rajasekara declared giving half of his kingdom to someone who could\r\n                                cure the hapless Princess.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The team of soldiers sent by Rajasekara with the sole purpose of getting the milk\r\n                                returned empty-handed. Manikandan tried to help, but the King would not heed his pleas\r\n                                to go to the forest, citing as reasons the tender age of the boy and the imminent\r\n                                coronation. Unperturbed, Manikandan asked his dad to give him a favor. Rajasekara, ever\r\n                                an indulgent father, instantly relented; the boy seizing the opportunity forced him to\r\n                                let him gather the milk. Manikandan blocked Rajasekara's attempts to assemble a band of\r\n                                brave men to follow him into the forest; he argued that the tigress would leave quietly\r\n                                when she saw the crowd of soldiers\r\n                                Reluctantly Rajasekara, in memory of Lord Shiva, bid farewell to his favorite son and\r\n                                made him take food stocks and three-eyed coconuts.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Lord Shiva's Panchabuthas followed Manikandan closely, as he entered the trees. But on\r\n                                the way, he chanced to witness the demoness Mahishi's atrocities at Devaloka. Outraged\r\n                                by his sense of justice, Manikandan hurled Mahishi down to the earth; she fell on the\r\n                                banks of the Azhutha River. A bloody war soon followed, and in the end Manikandan\r\n                                mounted the chest of Mahishi and began a violent dance that reverberated throughout the\r\n                                earth and the Devaloka. And the Devas were terrified. Mahishi realized that Hari and\r\n                                Haran's son was the divine being upon her, chastened, prostrated before the young child,\r\n                                and died.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Manikandan entered the forest for tigress 'milk after confrontation with Mahishi. He had\r\n                                a Lord Shiva darshan who told him that although he had accomplished the divine plan, he\r\n                                still had one important task to accomplish. Manikandan was reminded of his\r\n                                grief-stricken father and ailing mother; he was also assured of the aid of Lord Indran\r\n                                in obtaining the milk of the much coveted tigress. On Lord Devendran, disguised as a\r\n                                tiger, Manikandan made his way to the Royal Palace; they were followed as tiger by\r\n                                female devas in the form of tigresses and male devas.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The Pandalam people screamed when they saw the boy and the tigers, and they hurriedly\r\n                                sought shelter. Shortly after, the Sanyasi, who had first materialized in the forest\r\n                                before Rajasekara, revealed Manikandan's true identity to the wonder-struck Sovereign\r\n                                when he heard a child's wails once again. The King became quiet and thoughtful, as\r\n                                Manikandan and the tigers approached the palace gates. The boy descended from the back\r\n                                of the tiger and told the solemn King that he was able to get the milk from the\r\n                                tigresses and cure the Queen from the mysterious ailment.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Unable to control himself any longer, Rajasekara fell at the feet of the lad and begged\r\n                                for forgiveness, he had finally seen through the pretense of his Queen; the moment\r\n                                Manikandan left for the forest, her illness had ceased. Manikandan turned twelve years\r\n                                old the day he returned from the mountains.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                King Rajasekara wanted to punish his Diwan, since the latter was responsible for the\r\n                                forest exile of his family. However, Manikandan urged restraint; he maintained that\r\n                                everything had unfolded according to the divine order, through the will of God. He also\r\n                                told his father that he would return to Devaloka without fail, as he had completed the\r\n                                mission for which he had produced himself. Before his departure, the lad told the King\r\n                                that he would grant him whatever boon Rajasekara asked for, as he was satisfied with the\r\n                                unflinching trust and devotion of the latter.\r\n                                The King Rajasekara immediately told him they wanted to create a temple in his memory,\r\n                                and beseeched him to suggest an suitable location for the temple. Manikandan aimed for\r\n                                an arrow that dropped at a location called sabari where Dhavam was observed in the era\r\n                                of Sri Rama by a Sanyasini named sabari. Lord Manikandan told the King to build the\r\n                                temple in that place and then he disappeared.\r\n                                Later, acting upon the advice of Saint Agasthya King Rajasekara laid the foundation\r\n                                stone of the temple at Sabarimala. Lord Manikandan, had claimed emphatically that he\r\n                                will grace only those devotees who give Darshan after observing fortyone days' penance\r\n                                or vrtha that requires strict abstinence from family desires and tastes; the devotees\r\n                                are required to adhere to a way of life akin to that of a brahmachari, constantly\r\n                                focusing on the goodness of life.\r\n                                When they make their way up the steep slopes of Sabarimala, they adorn themselves in\r\n                                their heads with three-eyed coconut and food / Aantha Garland, as did the Bhagwan when\r\n                                he went to the forest to fetch tigress milk, and bathed in River Pampa raising Saranam\r\n                                slogans and ascending the eighteen stairs.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                In due course of time King Rajasekara completed the building of the shrine and the\r\n                                eighteen sacred stairs leading to the temple complex. As the King mulled over the\r\n                                apparently perplexing task of placing Dharmasastha's idol in the darshan temple, he was\r\n                                reminded of the words of the Lord himself-the Pampa River is a sacred river like the\r\n                                Ganga River, Sabarimala is as sacred as Kasi-Dharmasastha sent Parasuraman, who\r\n                                resurrected the land of Kerala from the bottom of the ocean, to Sabarimala; it was he\r\n                                who carved the image of Lord Ayyyappa.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Millions converge on Sabarimala every year, regardless of caste or religion, with\r\n                                garlands and irumudis, chanting paeans to Lord Ayyappa, bathing in the holy river Pampa,\r\n                                ascending the eighteen stairs, hoping to glimpse Lord Ayyappa, the Dharmasastha.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>behind the Makaravilakku</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Makaravilakku is part of a religious ritual performed in the past by the tribes in the\r\n                                Ponnambalamedu forest (where Makaravilakku appears) and then secretly continued by The\r\n                                Travancore Devaswom Board. The Makaravilakku has nothing mystical to it. The tribes have\r\n                                been practicing it for over hundreds of years. Actually there is a temple in the\r\n                                Ponnambalamedu, the place is not open to the public it is under the jurisdiction of\r\n                                Kerala's Forest Department. When on Makaram I the Sirius star appears in the sky, these\r\n                                tribes conduct their rituals in that temple too.\r\n                                As in the Sabarimala temple, they also conduct Arathi circling the fire around the Idol.\r\n                                It is carried out in a vessel by lighting camphor and ghee, and is circled three times\r\n                                around the idol.

Kathakali is another classical Kerala dance form. Mohiniyattam\r\n                                dance derives its name from the word Mohini – a mythical enchanting avatar of the Hindu\r\n                                god Vishnu, who helps the good triumph over evil by cultivating her feminine powers.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Like other classical Indian dances, Mohiniyattam's origins are in the Natya Shastra –\r\n                                the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performing arts. It follows however the Lasya style\r\n                                mentioned in Natya Shastra, which is a delicate, eros-filled and feminine dance. After\r\n                                intensive preparation it is typically a solo dance performed by women. Mohiniyattam's\r\n                                repertoire includes Carnatic-style music, singing and acting a play through dance, where\r\n                                the recitation may either be performed by a separate vocalist or the dancer herself. The\r\n                                song is traditionally called Manipravalam in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The earliest mention of the word is found in the 16th-century legal text Vyavaharamala,\r\n                                but the probable origins of the dance are older. The dance was systematized in the 18th\r\n                                century, and ridiculed during the colonial British Raj as a Devadasi prostitution\r\n                                system, outlawed by a series of laws from 1931 to 1938, a ban that was protested and\r\n                                partially repealed in 1940. Ultimately, the socio-political conflict brought renewed\r\n                                interest, revival and reconstruction of Mohiniyattam by the people of Kerala,\r\n                                particularly poet Vallathol Narayana Menon.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The origin of Mohiniyattam's is uncertain, according to Reginald Massey. Kerala, the\r\n                                region where this dance genre evolved and is popular, has a long history of lasya-style\r\n                                dances, the basics and structure of which may be at the heart. In Kerala temple\r\n                                sculpture is found the earliest evidence of Mohiniyattam, or a dance style similar to\r\n                                Mohiniyattam. In Mohiniyattam pose, the Vishnu temple of the 11th century at\r\n                                Trikodithanam, and the Kidangur Subramanya temple have many sculptures of female\r\n                                dancers. The textual evidence from the 12th century onwards indicates that Lāsyā themes\r\n                                were included by the Malayalam poets and playwrights.\r\n                                Nambootiri's Vyavaharamala of the 16th century contains the first known mention of the\r\n                                word Mohiniyattam, in connection with a payment to be made to a Mohiniyattam dancer.\r\n                                Another book, Gosha Yatra, from the 17th century also mentions the term. The Balarama\r\n                                Bharatam of the 18th century, a major secondary work written in Kerala on Natya Shastra,\r\n                                mentions many dance styles like Mohini Natana.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Mohiniyattam flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries when dance arts earned\r\n                                patronage from competing princely states. In particular, the funding and construction by\r\n                                the Hindu king, poet and music composer Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma of an early 19th\r\n                                century joint Mohiniyattam and Bharatanatyam team of artists led to the growth and\r\n                                systematization of modern Mohiniyattam.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-oachirakali',\r\n  templateUrl: './oachirakali.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./oachirakali.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class OachirakaliComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<section class=\"app1 download\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1500\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-content center-mobile\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/a8.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-1 col-md-6\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-text\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <div class=\"download-img d-flex\">\r\n                            <div class=\"set-relative\">\r\n\r\n                                <div class=\"set-abs elipse center-abs\">\r\n                                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/download/Ellipse.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"center-img-content m-l-15\">\r\n                                <h3 class=\"m-b-5 focolor\">Oachira Kali</h3>\r\n                                <p></p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"information\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n\r\n                                Ochira Kali is a unique festival held in the Ochira Parabrahma Temple which shows a mock\r\n                                fight between two groups, to the sound of drums, in a waterlogged field called\r\n                                padanilam.\r\n\r\n                                This festival is held as a commemoration of the historic war, fought between the former\r\n                                kingdoms of Kayamkulam and Ambalapuzha.

Some people believe\r\n                                the name of the place came from the word Omkarachira and others say the name comes from\r\n                                the name Oymanchira. There are also firm convictions that the name deriving from\r\n                                Uvachanchira as Uvachan means Lord Siva by belief. Many of those conclusions are\r\n                                myth-based.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Perhaps the real reason for getting to Oachira's name is different. To this end, we can\r\n                                consider the observations made by the two British officials, Ward and Conner, who\r\n                                conducted a survey during the early 19th century in the former Travancore. It was stated\r\n                                in their survey report that there was a large reservoir in the center of the broad\r\n                                ground called Padanilam. This reservoir (tank / pond / chira) was in the Padanilam\r\n                                centre.\r\n                                In olden days, the soldiers used this chira to bathe and provide water to the horses\r\n                                used in the war exercises. In ancient days this chira may have been known as\r\n                                Onattuchira, as the place belonged to the Kayamkulam Raja, also called the Odanattu\r\n                                Raja, or simply Onattu Rajah. Kayamkulam Raja's headquarters was then in Krishnapuram,\r\n                                very close to the Padanilam. So it is assumed that the word Onattuchira was eventually\r\n                                adopted as the name of the town, and that word was corrupted into Oachira as time went\r\n                                by further. This is quite a reasonable theory given that there are so many examples of\r\n                                the transformation of place names in known history.\r\n                                <br><br><br>\r\n                                <b>Getting there</b>\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Nearest railway station: Ochira, at walking distance\r\n                                Nearest airport: Trivandrum International Airport, about 105 km\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-onam',\r\n  templateUrl: './onam.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./onam.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class OnamComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<section class=\"app1 download\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1500\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-content center-mobile\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/a1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-1 col-md-6\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-text\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <div class=\"download-img d-flex\">\r\n                            <div class=\"set-relative\">\r\n                               \r\n                                <div class=\"set-abs elipse center-abs\">\r\n                                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/download/Ellipse.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"center-img-content m-l-15\">\r\n                                <h3 class=\"m-b-5 focolor\">Onam</h3>\r\n                                <p>Cultural festival</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"information\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                Onam is a Hindu holiday and festival held annually in Kerala, India.

Sequentially, the ten days are numbered Atham, Chithira, Chodhi,\r\n                                Vishakam, Anizham, Thriketa, Moolam, Pooradam, Uthradam, and Thiruvonam. The first and\r\n                                the last day in Kerala and in other communities of Malayalee are especially significant.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>History:</b>\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                In Hindu mythology, Mahabali was the great-grandfather of a Brahmin sage\r\n                                named Kashyapa, the great-grandfather of the evil tyrant, Hiranyakashipu, and Vishnu\r\n                                devotee grandson Prahlada. This ties the festival to Holika fame Prahlada's Puranic\r\n                                mythology in Hinduism, who was Hiranyakashipu's wife. Despite being born to an evil\r\n                                Asura father who despised Vishnu, Prahlada rebelled against the oppression of people by\r\n                                his parents, and worshiped Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu attempts to kill his son Prahlada, but\r\n                                in his Narasimha form, Vishnu is slain and Prahlada is rescued.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The grandson of Prahlada, Mahabali, came to power by slaying gods and taking the three\r\n                                worlds over. The defeated Devas asked Vishnu for aid in their war with Mahabali\r\n                                according to the Vaishnavism mythology. Vishnu declined to join the gods in violence\r\n                                against Mahabali, for Mahabali was a decent ruler and devotee of his own. Instead he\r\n                                wanted to check the dedication of Mahabali at a appropriate time. After his triumph over\r\n                                the gods, Mahabali announced he would do a Yajna and grant any request during the Yajna\r\n                                to everyone.\r\n                                Vishnu took, and approached Mahabali, the avatar – his fourth – of a dwarf boy named\r\n                                Vamana. The king offered the boy something-gold, cows, elephants, villages, food,\r\n                                whatever he wanted. The boy said one shouldn't be searching for more than one wants and\r\n                                all he wanted was \"three pieces of land.\" Mahabali agreed.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Vamana grew to a massive scale, and Mahabali ruled all in just two paces. For the third\r\n                                rate, Mahabali offered his head for Vishnu to step on, an act that Vishnu embraced as\r\n                                evidence of Mahabali's devotion. Vishnu granted him a boon by which Mahabali could once\r\n                                again visit the lands and people he had previously ruled, once a year. This revisit\r\n                                marks Onam's festival as a reminder of Vishnu's virtuous law and modesty in accordance\r\n                                with his word. Mahabali's last day of stay is honored with a vegetarian nine-course\r\n                                feast at Onasadya.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                \r\n\r\n\r\n                            </p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                       \r\n                    </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</section>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-padayani',\r\n  templateUrl: './padayani.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./padayani.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class PadayaniComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<section class=\"app1 download\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-5 col-md-6\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1500\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-content center-mobile\">\r\n                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/a3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-6 offset-lg-1 col-md-6\">\r\n                <div class=\"center-text\">\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <div class=\"download-img d-flex\">\r\n                            <div class=\"set-relative\">\r\n\r\n                                <div class=\"set-abs elipse center-abs\">\r\n                                    <img src=\"assets/images/app_landing1/download/Ellipse.png\" alt=\"\">\r\n                                </div>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div class=\"center-img-content m-l-15\">\r\n                                <h3 class=\"m-b-5 focolor\">Padayani</h3>\r\n                                <p>Cultural festival</p>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"information\">\r\n                            <p>\r\n\r\n                                Padayani, also known as Padeni, is a traditional folk dance and ritual art from the\r\n                                central part of Kerala's Indian state. A ceremonial dance involving masks, it is an old\r\n                                practice performed in temples of Bhagavati. In memory of Bhadrakaali the dance is done.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Padayani is an art form combining music, dance, theatre, satire, masks and paintings. It\r\n                                is part of Bhadrakali worship and is staged from mid-December to mid-May in temples\r\n                                dedicated to the goddess. Padayani is located in central Travancore, which includes\r\n                                Kerala's Pathanamthitta district. Padayani is considered a legacy of the Dravidian\r\n                                worship forms which existed before the advent of Brahmanism.\r\n                                The Patayani percussion instruments are patayani thappu, chenda, para, and kumbham.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>Orgin</b>\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Padyani is a modern Kolam Thullal style, a ritual dance performed by Kerala's\r\n                                magic-medicine people. In the past, this elaborate and costly event was carried out to\r\n                                cure diseases of deep psychological dysfunctions without any apparent specific physical\r\n                                cause, and cases that seemed unfit for medical modalities of intervention. This type of\r\n                                psychological or spiritual healing, otherwise known as Kolam Thullal, was planned,\r\n                                regulated and performed exclusively by the Tinta sub-sect of the Thullal.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Another version of its origin has to do with ancient martial arts training in Kerala.\r\n                                The Ganaka people have been known by society since the Samgham period as traditional\r\n                                preceptors of martial arts and letters. Since the root of term padayani relates to\r\n                                military parade or army ranks, it is widely believed that the Nair trainees (fighters)\r\n                                and their Preceptors-Kalari Asans (Kaniyar Panicker) emerged from a symbolic past\r\n                                reminiscent of the fencing march of martial art to fear the enemy troop and demonstrate\r\n                                their strength.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The roles of different functions related to this dance were gradually divided and\r\n                                distributed to people from different communities. Thus the Nair folk became the\r\n                                performers of the modern form of Padayani art, but the local Kaniyar people had the\r\n                                right to write songs, the design and the making of elaborate costumes. Today the modern\r\n                                form of Padayani is performed in many Devi temples in the southern region of Kerala,\r\n                                particularly in the districts of Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Alappuzha, and Kollam.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>Story of padayani</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                A very destructive war between the devas (gods) and the asuras (anti-gods) left the\r\n                                asura class only to two women, Danavathi and Darumathi. Left to themselves, they\r\n                                performed tapasya (penance of devotion), to satisfy the founder of Brahma. Through begot\r\n                                a son, Danava and Darika by his blessings. When Darika reached age Darumathi told him\r\n                                the sad tale of the devas 'loss and devastation of their class. She exhorted him to do\r\n                                penance in order to please Brahma and gain powers with which to regain their class's\r\n                                lost glory. Darika performed arduous apasy that could not be ignored by Brahma, and he\r\n                                blessed him with forces that could protect him from harm by man or god day and night.\r\n                                Brahma bestowed on him the mighty Brahma rod, a tool of great destructive power. Yet an\r\n                                arrogant turn by the asura angered Brahma who attached a divine damsel to the luck of\r\n                                his devotee's death. Darika constructed a magnificent palace on the shores of the\r\n                                western sea with the aid of the supernal architect Maya, and declared safety and honor\r\n                                for all the remaining members of his class scattered and hiding. He reconstituted the\r\n                                asura army with their help, fought the chief of gods with Indra, and defeated him.\r\n                                With this Darika has not ended. He made occasional military excursions into the devas\r\n                                'territories, and became a constant threat to them. Thus Brahma created Brahmi, Vishnu\r\n                                created Vaishnavi and Shiva Maheswari, Indra Indrani, Subrahmanya Kumari, and Yama\r\n                                Varahi. The gods in distress appealed to Vishnu the great god of survival who directed\r\n                                them to Shiva who told them that only a goddess of extraordinary prowess could slay\r\n                                Darika. And their joint effort could not beat Darika. Then fate came in Darika's way, in\r\n                                the form of Narada, the celestial monk.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The haughty asura reproached the priest, threatening to kill him. The distraught Narada\r\n                                went to Kailasa, and complained of the demonic conduct to Shiva. The angered Shiva\r\n                                created Bhadrakali from his third eye and entrusted the task of destroying the asura to\r\n                                her. Darika's minister killed in the battle which followed Bhadrakali. Provoked, Darika\r\n                                wanted to challenge Kali, but he transferred all the important mantras (invocation\r\n                                hymns) to his aunt, before going to the battlefield.\r\n                                Darika used the brahma rod which forced Kali to withdraw. Goddess Kartyayani, Kali's\r\n                                friend, who knew Darika was no longer the sole owner of his powerful mantras, deceived\r\n                                the asura's wife into disguising herself as an innocent Brahmin child. Despite all the\r\n                                opponent's strong mantras now with her, Kali fought with Darika and caught Brahma's rod\r\n                                on the twenty-second day, cut off her opponent's head and kill her thirst with his\r\n                                blood. And after the war ended Kali's wrath raged. Her army of goddesses and phantoms,\r\n                                frightened at their leader's unusual wrath, fled the area, seeking refuge in Shiva.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Shiva has suggested multiple entertainment ways to calm her down.

The devotees would\r\n                                stand or some would sit on a holy tree in front of the shrine. This is, in short, an\r\n                                open theatre. According to its importance and hierarchy a output of a specific deity in\r\n                                the shrine continues with intervals for 12 to 24 hours. In the rituals will reside the\r\n                                chief dancer who propitiates the shrine's main deity.\r\n                                Further, this particular dancer wouldn't eat anything for the rest of that day after the\r\n                                sunsets. Specialists and other dancers make up his make up. The performance's first part\r\n                                is usually known as Vellattam, or Thottam. It is done without any elaborate costume or\r\n                                proper makeup. This time only a thin, red headdress is worn.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Together with the drummers, the dancer recites the specific ritual song explaining the\r\n                                myths and legends about the shrine deity or the folk deity to be propitiated.\r\n                                Accompanying this is playing folk musical instruments. The dancer returns to the\r\n                                greenroom after performing this main ritualistic aspect of the invocation. Again he\r\n                                appears with full makeup and costumes after a short break. Face-painting habits are\r\n                                distinctive. Vairadelam, kattaram, kozhipuspam, kottumpurikam, and prakkezhuthu are some\r\n                                of these patterns.\r\n                                For face painting primarily primary and secondary colors are used with contrast. In the\r\n                                dances, it helps to affect some stylisation. Then the dancer comes into the shrine's\r\n                                specific deity in front of the altar, and slowly \"metamorphoses.\" He, after performing\r\n                                several rituals, puts the head-dress on his head, and starts to dance. Folk musical\r\n                                instruments such as chenda, tudi, kuzhal, and veekni are played at a certain pace in the\r\n                                background. All of the dancers take in their hands a shield and kadthala (sword) as a\r\n                                continuation of the arms cults. The dancer then circumnavigates the temple, runs through\r\n                                the courtyard and starts to dance there.\r\n                                The dance of The Theyyam has different steps known as Kalaasams. Each Kalasam is\r\n                                systematically repeated from the first through the eighth step of footwork. A\r\n                                performance is a mixture of musical instruments, vocal recitations, dance, and special\r\n                                (usually mainly orange) make-up and costumes.

The largest temple festival in Kerala was the one-\r\n                                festival held in Aarattupuzha, known as Arattupuzha Pooram, before the start of Thrissur\r\n                                Pooram. Temples were frequent participants in and around the town of Thrissur. In the\r\n                                year 1798 the temples with from Thrissur were late for the Arattupuzha Pooram because of\r\n                                incessant rains and were denied entry to the Pooram procession. Feeling ashamed and\r\n                                frustrated at the refusal, the authorities at the temple discussed the matter with\r\n                                Sakthan Thampuran.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                This made him agree to unify the 10 temples around Vadakkunnathan Temple, and organize\r\n                                the Thrissur Pooram celebration as a mass festival. He invited temples to the town of\r\n                                Thrissur with their deities to pay obeisance to King Vadakkunnathan (King Siva), the\r\n                                Vadakkunnathan Temple presiding deity. What's interesting about this festival is that\r\n                                all the festival uses is made fresh from scratch every year. There are individuals who\r\n                                have the responsibility to design the umbrellas and nettipattam.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>Participants</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                The temples were ordered by Sakthan Thampuran into two groups: \"Paramekkavu side\" and\r\n                                \"Thiruvambady side.\" The key attendees, Paramekkavu Bagavathi Temple at Thrissur Swaraj\r\n                                Circle, and Thiruvambadi Sri Krishna Temple at Shoranur Road, head these. The two\r\n                                temples are within 500 meters of each other.\r\n                                The Pooram is based on the Vadakkunnathan Temple, with both of these temples sending\r\n                                their processions to the Shiva, the presiding deity, to pay obeisance. It is assumed\r\n                                that the Thampuran has chalked out the Thrissur Pooram festival program and the main\r\n                                events.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The pooram begins early in the morning at the time of Kanimangalam sasthavu\r\n                                ezhunnellippu, and is followed by the ezhunnellippu of six other temples. One of\r\n                                Thrissur Pooram's main events is \"Madathil varavu,\" a panchavadhyam melam in which more\r\n                                than 200 artists participate, with instruments such as thimila, madhalam, trumpet,\r\n                                cymbal and edakka. At 2:00 am, the Ilanjithara melam, consisting of drum, trumpets, pipe\r\n                                and cymbal, starts within the vadakkumnathan temple.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                The pooram has a large set of elephants (more than 50) furnished with beautifully made\r\n                                Kolam nettipattam, decorative bells, and ornaments.\r\n\r\n                                After the Ilanjithara melam, at the end of the pooram, both groups of Paramekkavu and\r\n                                Thiruvambadi join the temple through the western gate, emerge through the southern gate\r\n                                and array themselves face to face in distant locations. The two groups competitively on\r\n                                top of the elephants in the presence of melam exchange colorful and made umbrellas,\r\n                                called Kudamattom, which is the pooram's eye-catching attraction.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                Later all the poorams at Nilapaduthara close to the western gopuram of Vadakkunnathan\r\n                                Temple conclude.\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                <b>Farewell</b>\r\n                                <br>\r\n                                The pooram's seventh day is his last day.

Ithe vishu is\r\n                                celebrated by giving Vishu kai neetam, by exchanging the money it is a blessing from the\r\n                                family.\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                Usually the Vishu arrangement includes a Vishnu image, usually in Lord Krishna form.\r\n                                People\r\n                                also visit temples like Sabarimala Ayyappan Temple or Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple or\r\n                                Kulathupuzha Sree BaalaShastha Temple in the early hours of the day to get a 'Vishukkani\r\n                                Kazhcha.'\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                <b>Vishukkani</b>\r\n                                <br><br>\r\n                                The word \"kani\" in Malayalam literally means \"what is first seen,\" so \"Vishukkani\" means\r\n                                \"what is first seen on Vishu.\" The traditional belief is that one's future is a result\r\n                                of what one encounters, that if one considers auspicious joyous events as the first\r\n                                thing on Vishu, the new year would be better. Hence, women in Malayali spend the\r\n                                day preparing a room, usually a tray, of auspicious objects.

The most famous legend will have it lifted from\r\n                    the depths of the ocean to the land crust that shapes the State. Lord Vishnu's Brahmin avatar\r\n                    Parasurama had waged an epic sequence of vindictive wars on the Kshatriyas. Came a moment when\r\n                    regret overwhelmed Parasurama at the wanton devastation he had wrought. He gave extreme penance up\r\n                    the heights of the mountain. The sage heaved his mighty axes into the middle of the distant ocean in\r\n                    a mood of profound atonement.\r\n                    The waves shoamed and frothed as a prawn-shaped land extending from Gokarnam to Kanyakumari emerged\r\n                    to form the State from the depths of the sea and thus the sobriquet 'Gods Own country.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    The word Kerala was first epigraphically documented by Emperor Ashoka of Magadha as Cheras in a rock\r\n                    inscription of the 3rd century BCE. During the time of Ashoka, it was listed as one of four\r\n                    independent kingdoms in South India, the other being the Cholas, Pandyas and Satyaputras. Through\r\n                    developing trade ties across the Arab Sea with all major Mediterranean and Red Sea ports as well as\r\n                    those of the Far East, the Cheras turned Kerala into an international trading hub.

In Hinduism, he is credited with unifying and creating the main\r\n                    currents of thought.\r\n                    His works in Sanskrit address the unity of the \"brahman without qualities\" of the alien and Nirguna\r\n                    Brahman. In support of his study, he wrote numerous commentaries on the Vedic canon. His plays build\r\n                    on the Upanishads 'concepts. Shankara's publications criticized Hinduism's ritual-oriented Mīmāsā\r\n                    school. He also clarified the main distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism, arguing that Hinduism\r\n                    believes \"there is a man there,\" while Buddhism believes there is \"no spirit, no self.\"\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Shankara moved around the Indian subcontinent to share his philosophy with other thinkers through\r\n                    discourses and debates. In a time when the Mīmāsā school developed strict ritualism and mocked\r\n                    monasticism, he developed the importance of monastic life as sanctioned in the Upanishads and Brahma\r\n                    Sutra. He is reputed to have established four mathas (\"monasteries\"), which helped in Advaita\r\n                    Vedanta's historical growth, revival, and spread of which he is recognized as the greatest\r\n                    revivalist. It is claimed that Adi Shankara is the organiser of the monastic order of Dashanami and\r\n                    consolidated the practice of worship of Shanmata.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor1\"><u>9th century</u></h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-sub-text mb-0 artsyle1 \">\r\n                <p class=\"p-light about-para focolor1\">\r\n                    In the 9th century the Cheras regained power over Kerala until the kingdom was abolished in the 12th\r\n                    century, after which small autonomous chiefdoms emerged, most notably Venadu.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n\r\n                    <a [routerLink]=\"['/blog/his2']\">\r\n                       next page...\r\n                    </a>\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n           \r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>","import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-his2',\r\n  templateUrl: './his2.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./his2.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class His2Component implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor() { }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit(): void {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n","<div class=\"col-md-8 offset-md-2 artsyle\">\r\n    <div class=\"center-text\">\r\n        <div class=\"\">\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor text-center\">History of Kerala\r\n                </h2>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor1\"><u>Chera dynasty</u></h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-sub-text mb-0 artsyle1 \">\r\n                <p class=\"p-light about-para focolor1\">\r\n                    The Chera dynasty (or Cēra) was one of the key lines in the early history of the present-day states\r\n                    of Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India. In the early centuries of the Common Age, along with the\r\n                    Cholas of Uraiyur and the Pandyas of Madurai, the early Cheras were recognized as one of the three\r\n                    major (muventar) forces of ancient Tamilakam (a macro region in southern India). The trade of spices\r\n                    with Middle Eastern and Graeco-Roman merchants, in particular black pepper, is attested in several\r\n                    documents.\r\n                    Known to have had their original center at Karur in the interior of Tamil Nadu and harbors at\r\n                    Muchiri (Muziris) and Thondi (Tyndis) on the coast of the Indian Ocean (Kerala), the Cheras of the\r\n                    early historical period (c. second century BCE-c. third century CE) are.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Early historical pre-Pallava Tamil policies are often described as \"kinship-based redistributive\r\n                    economies\" largely influenced by \"pastoral-cum-agrarian subsistence\" and \"predatory politics.\"Tamil\r\n                    Brahmi cave label inscriptions describe Ilam Kadungo, son of Perum Kadungo, and Ko Athan Cheral's\r\n                    grandson of the Irumporai clan. The Chera bow and arrow emblem were also found on the reverse of\r\n                    these coins. The anthologies of early Tamil texts constitute a major source of early Cheras\r\n                    knowledge.

Present-day central Kerala was possibly separated from the Kingdom of Kongu\r\n                    Chera around the 8th-9th century A.D. to form the Kingdom of Chera Perumal (c. 9th-12th century\r\n                    A.D.). The exact nature of the ties between the different branches of Chera rulers is quite\r\n                    uncertain.\r\n                    Some of South India's major medieval dynasties-Chalukya, Pallava, Pandya, Rashtrakuta, and\r\n                    Chola-seem to have occupied the nation of Chera or Kerala. As of the 11th century AD, Kongu Cheras\r\n                    seems to have been incorporated into the Pandya political system. Even after the breakup of the\r\n                    Perumal Kingdom, royal inscriptions and temple grants, particularly from outside Kerala proper,\r\n                    continued to refer to the country and the people as the \"Cheras or Keralas.\" Venad's rulers, based\r\n                    in the port of Kollam in south Kerala, asserted their Perumal ancestry.

During its zenith, the\r\n                    kingdom occupied much of modern-day central and southern Kerala with the Irinjalakuda Koodalmanikyam\r\n                    temple enclave of Thachudaya Kaimal in the neighboring Kingdom of Cochin, as well as the Kanyakumari\r\n                    district, now in the Tamil Nadu Indian state. The state's official flag was red in its middle, with\r\n                    a dextrally-coiled silver conch shell.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    King Marthanda Varma inherited Venad's small feudal state in 1723, and developed it into Travancore,\r\n                    one of Southern India's most powerful kingdoms. During the Travancore-Dutch War of 1739–46 which\r\n                    culminated in the Battle of Colachel, Marthanda Varma led the Travancore armies. Travancore's Dutch\r\n                    defeat is considered to be the earliest example of an Asian centralized force defeating European\r\n                    military technology and tactics. Marthanda Varma managed to conquer most of the native rulers 'small\r\n                    principalities that had allied against him with the Dutch.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    In the early 19th century, the kingdom became a princely state of the British Empire. The Travancore\r\n                    Government took many progressive steps on the socio-economic front and during the reign of Maharajah\r\n                    Sri Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, Travancore became the second most prosperous princely state in\r\n                    British India, with reputed achievements in education, political administration, public work, and\r\n                    social reforms.\r\n                    There were also small autonomous Kingdoms in the area. Later, during the peak period of\r\n                    Chera-Chola-Pandya, this region was a part of the Kingdom of Chera (with the exception of the\r\n                    Kingdom of Ay which was still independent). It was still known as Thiruvazhumkode during that time,\r\n                    when the region was part of the Chera empire. It was contracted to Thiruvankode, and anglicised to\r\n                    Travancore by the English.\r\n                    Over time, the Ay kingdom became independent, part of the Chera empire that ruled the\r\n                    Thiruvazhumkode district, and the land was called Aayi Desam or Aayi Rajyam, meaning 'Aayi\r\n                    territory.' The Aayis ruled the land north from the present district of Kollam, via the district of\r\n                    Thiruvananthapuram, all in Kerala, to the district of Kanyakumari. Two capitals existed, the main\r\n                    one at Kollam (Venad Swaroopam or Desinganadu) and one at Thrippapur.\r\n                    And the kingdom was renamed Venad too. Venad's kings had traveled from Kollam at different times and\r\n                    built residential palaces in Thiruvithamcode and Kalkulam. Thiruvithamcode was the capital of the\r\n                    Swaroopam Thrippapur, and Europeans renamed the country Thiruvithamcode even after the capital had\r\n                    moved to Padmanabhapuram, near Kalkulam, in 1601.\r\n\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor1\"><u>Formation of Travancore</u></h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-sub-text mb-0 artsyle1 \">\r\n                <p class=\"p-light about-para focolor1\">\r\n                    Travancore's history started with Marthanda Varma, who inherited the Kingdom of Venad (Thrippappur),\r\n                    and during his reign (1729–1758) extended it to Travancore.

In this battle, the Dutch admiral Eustachius De Lannoy\r\n                    was captured and later defected to Travancore. De Lannoy was appointed Captain of His Highness\r\n                    'Bodyguard and later Senior Admiral, and by introducing guns and artillery he modernized the\r\n                    Travancore army.

He created a large standing army of about 50,000 men as part of the\r\n                    construction of a \"elaborate and well-organized\" war machine, reduced the influence of the Nair\r\n                    aristocracy and reinforced the northern frontier of his empire.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Under Marthanda Varma Travancore made a concerted attempt to consolidate his power through the use\r\n                    of Indian Ocean trade. Marthanda Varma's strategy was to give assistance to Syrian Christian\r\n                    merchants (as a way to restrict European involvement in ocean trade). The main commodity was black\r\n                    pepper, but other goods were also described as royal monopoly products (requiring a trade license)\r\n                    between the 1740s and 1780s. Finally, Travancore challenged and broke the Kerala coast's Dutch\r\n                    blockade.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Trivandrum became a prominent city in Kerala under Marthanda Varma. Marthanda Varma agreed in\r\n                    January 1750 to \"donate\" his kingdom to Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu) and subsequently to rule as the\r\n                    \"vice-regent\" of the deity (Sri Padmanabha Dasa). His successor, Rama Varma (\"Dharma Raja\"), had\r\n                    largely continued the policies of Marthanda Varma.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor1 \"><u>Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma</u></h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-sub-text mb-0 artsyle1 \">\r\n                <p class=\"p-light about-para focolor1\">\r\n                    Dharma Raja Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma (1724–1798) was Travancore's Maharajah from 1758 to 1798,\r\n                    until his death.

It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.\r\n                     <br> <br><b>History: </b>\r\n                    In the 12th century, Kannur was an important trade centre, with strong business ties with Persia and Arabia. It served as the British Army headquarters on the west coast of India until 1887. The modern city is called Town of Kannur. The mostly prominent Kolathiri Rajas (Kings) were ruled as a district and surrounding areas. The district took the name Kannur when the state of Kerala was created, since the administrative offices were built here. Prior to that, Kannur had been under British rule under the Chirakkal taluk of Madras state. When the British ruled this part of the country, they chose Madras and Cochin to be their main stations and Kannur started to lose its old glory.\r\n                    The Kannur people are still waiting for their old glory to come back and they feel sidelined because the state administration is located on the exact opposite side of the district. Part of Kannur's original city was under the sole Muslim Royalty of Kerala called the Arakkal and this region is still regarded as a district.\r\n                     <br><br>\r\n                     The St. Angelo Fort was founded by the first Portuguese Viceroy of India, Dom Francisco de Almeida, in 1505. In 1663 the Dutch seized the Portuguese Castle. They modernized the fort and designed Hollandia, Zeelandia, and Frieslandia bastions which are the key characteristics of the present structure. The main Fort in Portugal was later taken down. The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam contains a drawing of this fort and the fishing boat behind it. In 1772 the Dutch sold the fort to Arakkal king Ali Raja.\r\n                     Kannur was the capital city of the one Muslim Sultanate in Kerala, known as Arakkal, during the 17th century. It was then captured by the British in 1790 and used as one of their main military stations along the Malabar Coast. Kannur was part of Madras province in the District of North Malabar during the British Raj.\r\n                     <br><br>\r\n                     Pazhassi Raja's guerrilla war against the British, ruler of Kottayam province, had a huge impact on Kannur's history. Changes in Kerala's socio-economic and political sectors during the initial decades of the 20th century produced congenial conditions for the Communist Party's development.\r\n                     Extension of English education initiated by Christian missionaries in 1906 and later carried forward by government, rebellion for wearing a cloth to cover upper parts of body, installing an idol at Aruvippuram in 1888, Malayali Memorial in 1891, establishment of SNDP Yogam in 1903, activities, struggles etc. became factors helpful to accelerate changes in Kerala society during a short time.\r\n                     Movements to free themselves from British imperialism's colonial rule and the struggles initiated by those movements grew with them.\r\n                     <br><br>\r\n                     Ideas about capitalism and the Soviet Revolution very soon reached Kerala. The works of Swadeshabhimani Ramakrishna Pillai, Sahodaran Ayyappan, P. Kesavadev and others propagated these ideas in Kerala. Some other important innovations took place by the early 1930's. Nivarthana Agitation was significant at Travancore among them. That was the demand of people oppressed to the degree that they were untouchable and poorer sections for government participation.\r\n                     It took battles like proportional government representation and job reservation to the forefront. This brought fresh excitement among the oppressed masses.\r\n                   </b>\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\"

After the reorganization of states and the establishment of Kerala in 1 November 1956, Kasaragod became a part of the Kannur district. In the year 1984 Kasaragod was proclaimed a district. Kasargod's merger with Kerala was a controversial issue as there is a significant population speaking Kannada and Tulu which are Karnataka's languages.\r\n                    On 25 October 1966 the Mahajan Commission was appointed by the Government of India to investigate the issue along with a similar issue that Karnataka had with Maharashtra over Belagaavi district. The commission was led by India's third Supreme Court chief justice, Meher Chand Mahajan. The commission suggested merging with Karnataka the part of the district that is north of the river Chandragiri, which includes the town of Kasargod.\r\n\r\n                </b>\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor\">Places To Visit In Kasargod</h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <section class=\"event team-sec team-grid speaker set-relative\" id=\"speaker\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj45.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n                        \r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\">Ranipuram Peak</h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \"> Tourist attraction</h6>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            Ranipuram hills is an enticing destination in district Kasaragod.

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the Kulashekara Empire (800–1102 AD). By around 1100 the Vempolinad Kingdom had fragmented into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur, and the latter had become a Cochin vassal.\r\n                    Originally the royal house had beeb in Vennimala, in Kottayam. It was defended by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and the locality came to be identified with the same name as the fort as a result. Thekkumkur kings subsequently moved their capital from the outskirts of Kottayam to Nattassery near Kumaranallore. It is assumed that the Thazhathangadi Kottayam was ruled by the Thekkumkur family.\r\n                    <br>\r\n                    The Portuguese and the Netherlands formed trade relations with these two kingdoms, trading in black pepper and other spices. After the Dutch East India Company was subjugated by the Kingdom of Travancore in 1742, Marthanda Varma's military operations advanced towards the neighboring kingdoms of the North, including Thekkumkur.\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor\">Places To Visit In Kottayam</h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <section class=\"event team-sec team-grid speaker set-relative\" id=\"speaker\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj17.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n                        \r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\">Kumarakom</h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \">Tourist attraction</h6>\r\n                        \r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            Kumarakom has a wide range of houseboats, and houseboat experience is well known around the world.

It is surrounded, as the name implies, by small mountains of lush greenery, bonded with many streams of freshwater that flow through the area. Kadalundi Puzha, a big river flowing around the town in Kerala.\r\n                    Malappuram is one of the few municipalities in the state that has a tremendous track record of cleaning the area. Recognition as the second 'best municipality in 2011 to preserve state government cleanliness and hygiene.\r\n                    The town has the same climatic conditions existing elsewhere in the province. By nature the climate is generally moderate, hot and humid. The Monsoon in the South West is normally very strong though. The best season to visit Malappuram, as the weather conditions are very good during the months of September to March.\r\n                    <br>\r\n                    Malappuram was an ancient military headquarters though the town's ancient history is hardly known. There are some pre-historic relics, however, particularly rock-cut caves found in some parts of the city such as Oorakam, Melmuri, Ponmala, Vengara etc. that manifest the inhabitants.\r\n                    Locality known as Valiyangadi, Kootilangadi, Pallipuram and so on points to Malappuram's Jain-Buddhist past. Notably, the 1500-year-old Jain Temple over 2000 ft above sea level on Malappuram's Oorakam Hill definitely proves the same.\r\n                    Eranadan Malappuram was under the Chera Empire, during the Sangam period. Places such as Pattar Kadav, Panakkad etc. may have grown out of Pattars and Panars who had lived there. But there are no further information about the people's life and culture either during the Sangam period or in the post-Sangam era.\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div class=\"format-head-text\" style=\"padding-top: 20px;\">\r\n                <h5 class=\"about-font-header gradient-text focolor\">Places To Visit In Malappuram</h5>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <section class=\"event team-sec team-grid speaker set-relative\" id=\"speaker\">\r\n    <div class=\"container\">\r\n        <div class=\"row\">\r\n            <div class=\"col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 speker-container\">\r\n                <div class=\"text-center d-flex\">\r\n                    <div class=\"team-img \">\r\n                        <img src=\"assets/images/event/aj32.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid\">\r\n                        <div class=\"overlay\"></div>\r\n                        \r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div class=\"employee\">\r\n                        <h5 class=\"e-name text-center focolor\"> Nilambur</h5>\r\n                        <h6 class=\"post text-center \"> Municipality in Kerala</h6>\r\n                        <p class=\"team-para\">\r\n                            Nilambur is a municipality in the Indian state of Kerala, in Malappuram district.
